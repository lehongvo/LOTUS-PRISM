# LOTUS-PRISM Project Implementation Guide

This document provides a step-by-step guide to implement the LOTUS-PRISM (Price & Retail Intelligence Streaming Monitor) project, a system for competitive price analysis and price/promotion optimization for Lotus's retail business.

## Project Overview

LOTUS-PRISM is an end-to-end data engineering solution that:
- Collects pricing data from competitors (AEON, Lotte Mart, Winmart, etc.)
- Processes both batch and streaming data
- Applies ETL processes to transform raw data into actionable insights
- Provides analytics through APIs and dashboards
- Recommends optimal pricing and promotion strategies

## Implementation Steps

### Phase 3: Data Processing

1. **Batch Processing Pipeline**
   - Implement data cleaning and transformation in PySpark
   - Create product categorization logic
   - Develop price normalization algorithms
   - Implement RFM analysis components
   - Set up Delta Lake tables in each layer
   - Create validation and monitoring for data quality

2. **Real-time Processing Pipeline**
   - Set up Kafka / Event Hubs topics
   - Create producer simulators for real-time price changes
   - Implement Spark Streaming jobs for processing
   - Develop real-time aggregation logic
   - Create notification system for significant price changes

### Phase 4: Analytics and Modeling

1. **Price Analytics Components**
   - Develop price comparison algorithms
   - Create price sensitivity analysis by category

### Phase 5: API Development

1. **REST API Implementation**
   - Set up Azure API Management
   - Create API endpoints for:
     - Price comparison data
     - Product category analysis
   - Implement authentication and rate limiting
   - Create API documentation with Swagger/OpenAPI

### Phase 6: Dashboards and Reporting

1. **Power BI Dashboard Development**
   - Create direct connectivity to Azure Synapse
   - Develop dashboard components:
     - Real-time price comparison
     - Promotion performance monitoring
     - Product category analysis
     - Price optimization recommendations
   - Implement scheduled refresh and alerts
   - Create executive summary reports

### Phase 7: Testing and Optimization

1. **Performance Testing**
   - Test data pipeline throughput
   - Verify real-time processing latency
   - Optimize query performance
   - Load test API endpoints

2. **Validation Testing**
   - Verify data accuracy across all layers
   - Validate recommendation algorithms
   - Test dashboard calculations
   - Ensure end-to-end data consistency

3. **Security Testing**
   - Perform penetration testing
   - Verify access controls
   - Validate encryption and data protection
   - Test API security features

### Phase 8: Documentation and Handover

1. **Documentation**
   - Create architectural documentation
   - Develop operations manual
   - Write API documentation
   - Create user guides for dashboards

2. **Training**
   - Conduct training sessions for:
     - Technical team managing the system
     - Business analysts using the dashboards
     - Executives interpreting the reports

3. **Maintenance Plan**
   - Define monitoring procedures
   - Create backup and disaster recovery plan
   - Establish update and maintenance schedule
   - Set up support processes

## Technology Stack

- **Cloud Platform**: Azure
- **Storage**: Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2, Delta Lake
- **Processing**: Azure Databricks, Apache Spark, PySpark
- **Streaming**: Apache Kafka / Azure Event Hubs
- **Data Warehouse**: Azure Synapse Analytics
- **Infrastructure as Code**: Terraform
- **API Development**: Python (Flask/FastAPI), Azure API Management
- **Visualization**: Power BI
- **Languages**: Python, SQL, Scala (optional)

## Development Workflow

1. Develop and test locally when possible
2. Use feature branches for development
3. Implement CI/CD for automated testing and deployment
4. Follow infrastructure-as-code principles for all resources
5. Document code and architecture continuously
6. Maintain test coverage for critical components

## Best Practices

- Use consistent naming conventions across all components
- Implement logging and monitoring from the beginning
- Create reusable modules for common functionality
- Prioritize data quality and validation
- Automate repetitive tasks
- Ensure proper error handling throughout the system
- Follow security best practices at every level
